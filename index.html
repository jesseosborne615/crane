    <p1>The cranes that line up in the sky<br>seem to wave goodbye<br>
        the dashboard's glowing yellow<br>and I am leaving my home<br>once again<br><br>
        It's the story of my life<br>lookin' round to find<br>
        another kindred mind<br>with experience like mine<br>
        Another different state<br>A lifetime away<br>
        Who fucking cares?<br>You're worth the wait<br><br>
        Sometimes, some nights<br>You'll let me make you feel alive<br>
        When this passion cannot be denied<br>
        Some time, some night<br>I'll tell you all the reasons why<br>
        That you are the love of my life<br><br>
        The stars that line up in the sky<br>Ain't got nothin' on those eyes<br>
        and you might've heard this once before<br>but I will love you 'til I die<br>
        It's another boring place<br>but I'll never be the same<br>
        I have found my missing spark<br> It's true love, it's fate<br>
        It's another boring place<br>but we'll never be the same<br>
        We have found our twin flames<br><br>
        Sometimes, some nights<br>You'll let me make you feel alive<br>
        When this passion cannot be denied<br>
        Some time, some night<br>I'll tell you all the reasons why<br>
        That you are the love of my life<br><br>
